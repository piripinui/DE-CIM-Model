# DE-CIM-Model
Provides example JSON schema definitions for assets and asset hierarchies. Also contains two NodeJS apps, schema-validator for checking JSON documents against the schemas at the command line and schema-server which serves the schema documents via a web server running on port 80 (accessible through URLs like http://localhost/DE_CIM_MODEL/abb.eam.asset.json).

The schema definitions are in schema-server/public/DE_CIM_Model. Example documents for testing are in schema-server/test-data.
